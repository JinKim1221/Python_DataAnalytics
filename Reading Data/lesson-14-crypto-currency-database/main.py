# restore the given cryptos.sql dump
c.executescript(open('files/cryptos.sql', 'r').read())


# Requirements
# The database we will use contains two tables `cryptocoins_cryptocurrency` and `cryptocoins_exchange`.
# Using the given sqlite3 connection and the `read_sql` method write a single query that:
#  - Join both tables and return the list of cryptocurrencies with its exchanges. You should use the column with the exchange ID on each table to perform the join.
#  - As both tables have a `name` column you should rename `cryptocoins_cryptocurrency.name` as `coin_name` and `cryptocoins_exchange.name` as `exchange`. Also select `symbol`, `price_usd` and `percent_change_7d` columns.
#  - Store the information in a `crypto_df` DataFrame.
# - Once you have the `crypto_df` DataFrame, create a new `weekly_change_df` with the `crypto_df` data sorted by `percent_change_7d` from highest to lowest.

# your code goes here

crypto_df = pd.read_sql('''select cryptocoins_cryptocurrency.name as coin_name, cryptocoins_exchange.name as exchange, symbol, price_usd, percent_change_7d 
                    from cryptocoins_cryptocurrency 
                    join cryptocoins_exchange 
                    on cryptocoins_cryptocurrency.exchange_id = cryptocoins_exchange.id''', conn)

weekly_change_df = crypto_df.sort_values('percent_change_7d', ascending=False)
print(weekly_change_df)
